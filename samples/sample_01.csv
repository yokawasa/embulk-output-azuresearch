50,Modeling Data for NoSQL Document Databases,"Ryan CrawCour, David Makogon","Application developers must support unprecedented rates of change ??functionality must rapidly evolve to meet customer needs and respond to competitive pressures. To address these realities, developers are increasingly selecting NoSQL document-oriented databases (e.g. Azure DocumentDB, MongoDB, CouchDB) for schema-free, scalable and high performance data storage. One of the oft-cited benefits of NoSQL solutions are that they allow for the storage of schema less data. In reality, however, NoSQL solutions provide for schema flexibility, allowing the system to store data as it comes in, permitting dissimilar structures and encouraging seamless data model iteration. While schema flexibility makes it easy to embrace changes to your data model, data modeling is still important in NoSQL systems. In this session, we??l discuss not only modeling data in Azure DocumentDB, but also migrating and transforming data from traditional, structured data environments. <img src=""http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&amp;dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Events/Build/2016/RSS&amp;WT.dl=0&amp;WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:4b264dafdca24ba1a0b0a5da00c470c0"" />",https://s.ch9.ms/Events/Build/2016/P468
